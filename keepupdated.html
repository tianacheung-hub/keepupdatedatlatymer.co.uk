Hi, this is a website where Latymer students can include information in a more efficient way. This is from an educational point of view where there are resources and information available. We aim to keep the momentum going and hopefully whilst being in lockdown, you can still educate yourself further and become a better ally.</p>
<p>If you want to write a blog or check out petitions and resources then go check out Zahra's BAME LDN page <a href="https://zahra-rahman.github.io/BAME-LDN.github.io/page2-about/page2-about.html">here!</a></p>

- ACS society are in the process of creating a BLM board for the Great Hall, although it is a way to appreciate and commemorate Black Men and Women's history and work, we believe it shouldn't stop there. So please try to educate yourself, and look at the resource pages below. </p>
<p>
- As curriculum is something to discuss changing, it is a long term process, so the English as well as History department are looking for ways to incorporate educating students whether that be through extra curriculum or on a student's own accord.
<p>
-Please keep updated with this website as well as Zahra's in the link above, I will keep updating so that your emails won't be spammed and can be a better way to take in information!
